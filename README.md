# About Trader

Trading goods physical goods has many opportunities for disputes and scams.

Anyone trading physical property for currency needs protection from dishonest
actors.

Powerful third parties are needed to conduct commerce safely, yet these can
charge large fees, even on transactions that have no need for arbitration.

Trader allows parties to conduct business with both sides being able to call
on an arbiter to settle any disputes.

When the arbiter is called upon they will be paid a fee from the money posted,
if there is no dispute the arbiter collects only a nominal fee.

This allows for honest parties doing business avoid fees for services they do
not need. While they still enjoy the protection of having a neutral mediator
to settle any potential disputes.
